Here, we show how to draw one using the most common species in the ALA database: the iconic Australian Magpie.\nSunburst plots for taxonomic data Since version 1.3.1 of galah, it has been possible to download taxonomic data using a ‘tree’ format from the data.tree package. Here I’ll demonstrate some ideas for plotting these trees using circular diagrams.\nCreating a color palette from an image There are hundreds of color palettes in the R ecosystem, but sometimes we might want to use colors from a specific image. Here I show how to use the paletter package to create a color palette for the 2020 Eucalypt of the Year: the Western Australian Gimlet."
